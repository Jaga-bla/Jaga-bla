## Hi, I'm Jagoda! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about genetics, bioinformatics, and web development. As a novice web developer, I'm eager to expand my knowledge and skills in these fields. Over the past year, I've been dedicated to learning Python programming, which serves as a solid foundation for both bioinformatics and web development.

To further enhance my expertise, I've recently embarked on postgraduate studies. These studies have not only systematized my knowledge but also provided me with a deeper understanding of good programming practices and databases. My ultimate goal is to secure a position as a backend developer, which would offer a great opportunity for me to fully immerse myself in the world of software engineering and continue my learning journey.

### Technologies I'm Familiar With

- Python

- DRF
- Flask
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- SQL
- Git
- Docker
