ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jagoda.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in genetics, bioinformatics and web development. 
I am a novice web developer, eager to expand my knowledge. For a year
I have been learning a python programming language. Moreover, I started
a postgraduate studies, which systematized my knowledge and expanded
it in the field of good programming practices and databases. Taking up
a job as a backend developer would be a great opportunity and allow me to
fully focus on learning software engineering.
